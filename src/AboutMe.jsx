                        I'm a junior at University of California, San Diego
                        majoring in computer science and minoring in cognitive 
                        science. I enjoy and have extensive experience creating 
                        practical applications that solve everyday problems
                        both inside and outside the classrom.
                        I am particularly interested in AI and its future 
                        possibilities. I've recently been working with JS, 
                        Python, and Django.
